# JavaScript-rocket
I sent a rocket into space with JavaScript
I made a rocket fly with JavaScript I created this project to practice JavaScript and made it pretty with some cute graphics. I styled the start console to give it a reto-isch NASA vibe. There is a 50/50 change of the rocket launch to fail but you can try again without having to spend a view million dollars to build a new rocket.
